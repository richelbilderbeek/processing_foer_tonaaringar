From Christoffer:

I did all exercises in Bok 1 & 2 of "Lektionskort 1: Graphics" as a test. I found these errors:
https://github.com/richelbilderbeek/processing_foer_ungdomar/blob/master/kapitel/flytta_bollen_till_hoeger_i_evighet/README.md:

 * From "intro" to "uppgift 1", the y position changes from 50 -> 100, and size of the ball changes from size 50x50 to 100x100 without any mention. If the kids stays with the instructions, the resulting image will not match the solution.
 * In "lösning 2", "float x = 50;" is not changed to "float x = 0;" or "float x = -50;" as suggested.
 * In "uppgift 3", the y position of the ball goes back to 50, as indicated both in the code and resulting image. The size of the ball stays at 100x100 however.
https://github.com/richelbilderbeek/processing_foer_ungdomar/blob/master/kapitel/rect_och_fill/README.md:

 * In "lösning 5", there is a typo, "width" have been translated to "bredd".
